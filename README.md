# Application observability for AWS Action

This action provides an end-to-end application observability investigation workflow that connects your source code and live production telemetry data to AI agent. It leverages CloudWatch MCPs and generates custom prompts to provide the context that AI agents need for troubleshooting and applying code fixes.

The action sets up and configures [AWS Application Signals MCP](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/cloudwatch-applicationsignals-mcp-server) and [AWS CloudWatch MCP](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/cloudwatch-mcp-server), enabling them to access live telemetry data as troubleshooting context. You can use your preferred AI model - whether through your own API key, a third-party model, or Amazon Bedrock - for application performance investigations.

To get started, mention `@awsapm` in your GitHub issues to trigger the AI agent. The agent will troubleshoot production issues, implement fixes, and enhance observability coverage based on your live application data.

## ✨ Features

With a one-time setup of Application observability for AWS Action workflow for your GitHub repository, you can:

1. **Troubleshoot Production Issues**: Investigate and resolve production problems using live telemetry and Service Level Objective (SLO) data
2. **Instrumentation Assistance**: Automatically instrument your applications directly from GitHub
3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Use AI agents to analyze performance issues, receive actionable recommendations, and apply code fixes

## 🚀 Getting Started
This action configures AI agents within your GitHub workflow by generating AWS-specific MCP configurations and custom observability prompts. You only need to provide IAM role to assume and a [Bedrock Model ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html) you want to use, or API token from your existing LLM subscription. The example below demonstrates a workflow template that integrates this action with [Anthropic's claude-code-base-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-base-action) to run automated investigations.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **GitHub Repository Permissions**: Write access or higher to the repository (required to trigger the action)
- **AWS IAM Role**: An IAM role configured with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for GitHub Actions with permissions for:
  - AWS Application Signals and CloudWatch access
  - Amazon Bedrock model access (if using Bedrock models)
- **GitHub Token**: The workflow automatically uses GITHUB_TOKEN with the required permissions

### Setup Steps

#### Step 1: Set up AWS Credentials

This action relies on the [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) action to set up AWS authentication in your GitHub Actions Environment. We recommend using OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate with AWS. OIDC allows your GitHub Actions workflows to access AWS resources using short-lived AWS credentials so you do not have to store long-term credentials in your repository.

1. Create an IAM Identity Provider

First, create an IAM Identity Provider that trusts GitHub's OIDC endpoint in the AWS Management Console:
* **Provider Type**: OpenID Connect
* **Provider URL**: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
* **Audience**: `sts.amazonaws.com`

2. Create an IAM Policy

Create an IAM policy with the required permissions for this action. See the [Required Permissions](#required-permissions) section below for details.

3. Create an IAM Role

Create an IAM role (for example, `AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN`) in the AWS Management Console with the following trust policy template. This allows authorized GitHub repositories to assume the role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<GITHUB_ORG>/<GITHUB_REPOSITORY>:ref:refs/heads/<GITHUB_BRANCH>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Replace the following placeholders in the template:

* `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` - Your AWS account ID
* `<GITHUB_ORG>` - Your GitHub organization name
* `<GITHUB_REPOSITORY>` - Your repository name
* `<GITHUB_BRANCH>` - Your branch name (e.g., main)

4. Attach the IAM Policy

In the role's Permissions tab, attach the IAM policy you created in step 2.


For more information about configuring OIDC with AWS,  see the [configure-aws-credentials OIDC Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-oidc-recommended).

#### Step 2: Configure Secrets and Add Workflow

1. Configure Repository Secrets

Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

  - Create a new repository secret named `AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN` and set its value to the ARN of the IAM role you created in Step 1.
  - (Optional) Create a repository variable named `AWS_REGION` to specify your AWS region (defaults to `us-east-1` if not set)

2. Add the Workflow File

Create Application Observability Investigation workflow from the following [template](./template/awsapm.yaml) to your GitHub Repository directory `.github/workflows`.
```yaml
name: Application observability for AWS

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  issues:
    types: [opened, assigned, edited]

jobs:
  awsapm-investigation:
    if: |
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@awsapm')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'issues' && (contains(github.event.issue.body, '@awsapm') || contains(github.event.issue.title, '@awsapm')))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: write        # To create branches for PRs
      pull-requests: write   # To post comments on PRs
      issues: write          # To post comments on issues
      id-token: write        # Required for AWS OIDC authentication

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1' }}

      # Step 1: Prepare AWS MCP configuration and investigation prompt
      - name: Prepare Investigation Context
        id: prepare
        uses: aws-actions/application-observability-for-aws@v1
        with:
          bot_name: "@awsapm"
          cli_tool: "claude_code"

      # Step 2: Execute investigation with Claude Code
      - name: Run Claude Investigation
        id: claude
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-base-action@beta
        with:
          use_bedrock: "true"
          # Set to any Bedrock Model ID 
          model: "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
          prompt_file: ${{ steps.prepare.outputs.prompt_file }}
          mcp_config: ${{ steps.prepare.outputs.mcp_config_file }}
          allowed_tools: ${{ steps.prepare.outputs.allowed_tools }}

      # Step 3: Post results back to GitHub issue/PR (reuse the same action)
      - name: Post Investigation Results
        if: always()
        uses: aws-actions/application-observability-for-aws@v1
        with:
          cli_tool: "claude_code"
          comment_id: ${{ steps.prepare.outputs.awsapm_comment_id }}
          output_file: ${{ steps.claude.outputs.execution_file }}
          output_status: ${{ steps.claude.outputs.conclusion }}
```

**Configuration Note:**
- This workflow triggers automatically when `@awsapm` is mentioned in an issue or comment
- The workflow uses the `AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN` secret configured in the previous step
- Update the model parameter in Step 2 to specify your preferred Amazon Bedrock model ID
- You can customize the bot name (e.g., `@awsapm-prod`, `@awsapm-staging`) in the bot_name parameter to support different environments

#### Step 3: Start Using the Action

Once the workflow is configured, mention @awsapm in any GitHub issue to trigger an AI-powered investigation. The action will analyze your request, access live telemetry data, and provide recommendations or implement fixes automatically.

**Example Use Cases:**

1. Investigate performance issues:

`@awsapm, can you investigate why my service is breaching its SLO?`

2. Enable instrumentation:

`@awsapm, please enable Application Signals for lambda-audit-service and create a PR with the required changes.`

3. Query telemetry data:

`@awsapm, how many GenAI tokens have been consumed by my services in the past 24 hours?`

**What Happens Next:**
1. The workflow detects the @awsapm mention and triggers the investigation
2. The AI agent accesses your live AWS telemetry data through the configured MCP servers
3. The agent analyzes the issue and either:
    * Posts findings and recommendations directly in the issue
    * Creates a pull request with code changes (for instrumentation or fixes)
4. You can review the results and continue the conversation by mentioning @awsapm again with follow-up questions


## 🔒 Security

This action prioritizes security with strict access controls, OIDC-based AWS authentication, and built-in protections against prompt injection attacks. Only users with write access or higher can trigger the action, and all operations are scoped to the specific repository.
